# programmazione1Unige
A repository containing all of the code I produce related to the course. Much more advanced than what is teached and used as a way to learn algorithms and data structures more througly, alongside learning c++ 

### Matlab
It's a branch of code that I don't particularly enjoy, but which I'm using as a challenge to implement algorithms and keep time/space complexity low

## CPP
Will start being mantained soon, and will contain my personal learning of the language itself
